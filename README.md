# Mission_To_Mars
### Overview:
First, I automated a web browser to visit different websites to extract data about the Mission to Mars. Secondly, I stored the data in a NoSQL database and rendered the data into a web application created with Flask. Finally, I created a web app that continuously updates with new information regarding the Mission to Mars. The current web app includes all four hemisphere images, the most recent facts about mars, and a featured mars image (all from the NASA website).

### Main Objectives:
- Set up the necessary scraping tools (Splinter, Web-Driver Manager, bs4 (BeautifulSoup, Flask, and MongoDB). Also, ensure that Homebrew is updated and ready to create a database using Mongod. 
- Create a MongoDB database to store the necessary data for the web scrape. 
- Create a web application through Flask that portrays the data.
- Scrape the data using the index.html to ensure the data was properly loaded into the database.
- Update the Web app with all of the required materials and ensure that it displays accurately.
- Customize the Web app to provide users with a clean and updated source.
